    <h2><b><u>Project Concept</u></b></h2>
    <body><p>
        The Website I would like to develop for my final project would be a digital storefront! Specifically for a online front of a hobby shop.
        Specifically, I personally enjoy the hobby of model kit building and have spent much of my personal time browsing sites such as this. 
        An online store front that displays all available products for a hobby store that supports many similar hobbies. From Model kits, to 
        RC Cars, or even DnD.
