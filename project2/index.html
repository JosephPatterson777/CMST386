    <h1 id = "topOfDocument"><u><strong>Final Project Proposal</strong></u></h1>
    <h2><b><u>Project Concept</u></b></h2><body>The Website I would like to develop for my final project would be a digital storefront! Specifically for a online front of a hobby shop.<br>
        Specifically, I personally enjoy the hobby of model kit building and have spent much of my personal time browsing sites such as this.<br> 
        An online store front that displays all available products for a hobby store that supports many similar hobbies. From Model kits, to<br> 
        RC Cars, or even DnD.</body>
    <h3><b><u>Objectives and Goals</u></b></h3><body>
        The Object of this project will to create a functional layout of a <em>digital store front</em>. This will include a homepage, search page,<br> 
        user page, and an example product page. The user should be able to search for keywords and browse multiple categories of products<br> 
        and navigate to the page of individual products. The user could then add those items to a cart for purchase.<br>
    </body><h3><b><u>Intended Audience</u></b></h3>
    <body>The intended audience is individuals involved in <em>hobbies</em>. These include RC vehciles, minatures, DnD, and Model kits.<br>
        <h4>Ordered for Priority</h4>

            </ol>
    </body><h3><b><u>Incoporated Features</u></b></h3>

    <h2>WireFrame</h2><img src = "WireFramecmst385jp.drawio.png">
    <h2><b><u>Project Resources</u></b></h2><body>
            The most important reference would be a few of the hobby sites I have ordered from in the past!<br>
            First would be <a href="https://www.hobbytown.com/" target ="_blank">Hobbytown</a>, a site for a shop I have actually visited a few times in real life.<br> 
            The second would be <a href="https://www.gundamplanet.com/" target="_blank">Gundam Planet</a>. I have never visited this site's physical location<br> 
            but I have ordered from them quite a few times.<br>
            I would use these sites as reference and attempt to Incoporate features that I like from them while avoiding some of the aspects I dislike. For example,<br> 
            I like how gundam planet has its category menu implemented but its functionality can lead to the menu closing preemptively which I dislike<br>
