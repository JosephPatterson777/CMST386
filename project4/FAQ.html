    <div id="flex-News"><h3>How do I build one of these kits?</h3>
        <div id="description">Generally, a look at a series of youtube videos on the topic would be far more informative but if you wanted a general rundown.
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Panel Line Parts on Runners</li>
                <li>Cut out parts with cutters</li>
                <li>Sand down parts where runner connections were</li>
                <li>Assemble step by step with instructions</li>
            </ol>
            Obviously, these are not nessarily in a required order, one can panel line before, after, or during assembly. Nor is this list exhaustive, 
            this hobby is about expressing your own personal vision of what a kit could be. So any amount of customizations or mods may be made. And entire
             categories of the industry exist to support those. Make the model you want to see!
