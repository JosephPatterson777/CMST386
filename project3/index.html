    <h2>The Fable behind the Band</h2>
    <p>The Protomen are an American rock band, known for their rock opera style and covers of various 1970s and 1980s songs.
    The origins of the band can be traced back to the Middle Tennessee State University in 2003, where the MTSU graduates of the band formed it in order to meet a class requirement of recorded performances.

    As for their music beginnings in the public eye, the band started with an album based in a dystopian version of the world of the NES Megaman games with their self titled album "The Protomen".</p>    
    <p>This specific storyline was then continued in their second album, "Act II: The Father of Death", with the band stating that a eventual third act album being planned to eventually complete the story.
